                    Sketchware Pro is a modified version of Sketchware, an Android app development platform. It was created
                    to enhance the functionality and features of the original Sketchware app. Sketchware Pro is an
                    open-source project that is maintained by a community of contributors.

                    The goal of Sketchware Pro is to provide developers with a more powerful and flexible tool for building
                    Android applications. It offers additional features, improvements, and customization options compared to
                    the original Sketchware app.

                    By being open-source, Sketchware Pro allows developers to contribute to its development, fix bugs, and
                    add new features. This collaborative approach ensures that the platform remains up-to-date and
                    responsive to the needs of the developer community.

                    Overall, Sketchware Pro is a valuable resource for Android developers, offering an enhanced development
                    experience and the opportunity to contribute to its ongoing improvement.
