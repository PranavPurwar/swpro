                This mod was not meant for any harmful purposes, such as harming Sketchware; Quite the opposite actually. It
                was made to keep Sketchware alive by the community, for the community. Please use it at your own discretion
                and consider becoming a Patreon backer of them, for example. Sadly, all other ways to support them aren't working anymore,
                so it's the only way available currently. Here's their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/sketchware">Patreon</a> page.

                We love Sketchware very much, and we are grateful to Sketchware's developers for making such an amazing app,
                but unfortunately, we haven't received updates for a long time. That's why we decided to keep Sketchware
                alive by making this mod, and we don't demand any money for it. It's completely free :)
